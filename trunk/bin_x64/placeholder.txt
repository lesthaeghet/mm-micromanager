This directory must exist before running a Visual Studio build, until we get
rid of the copy command in the post-build event. Otherwise, the first DLL build
will end up being copied to a file named "bin_x64".

This directory should be removed from the repository once we migrate to
specifying the Visual Studio OutDir via a default in a property sheet (i.e.
when Mark merges the VS2010 branch).

Instructions for building Micro-Manager on Windows<br>


January 21, 2007<br>


<br>


<h1>1. Preparation</h1>


<h2>1.1 Required tools and applications</h2>


To build the entire application from the source code, you will need to install the following tools:<br>


<ol>


  <li>Microsoft Developer Studio 2003 (7.1) with Visual C++</li>


  <li>JDK (Java developer's kit) standard edition, version 1.4 or later</li>


  <li>Beanshell 2.0.4 or later</li>


  <li>Apache ANT</li>


  <li>ImageJ 1.37v or later</li>


</ol>

<h2>1.2 Directory structure for the source code</h2>

When you unzip the source code, the default directory for the entire
source code is "micro-manager-1.0". &nbsp;This directory should reside
in the parent directory root of your choice. The root directory will be
referred to as &lt;root&gt;.
<h2>1.3 Required open source libraries</h2>


In addition to software tools you will need&nbsp; to install the
following software packages in the&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;root&gt;/3rdparty</span>&nbsp;directory:<br>


<ol>


  <li>SWIG version 1.3.24 and place it in "&lt;root&gt;/3rdparty/SWIG-1.3.24" subdirectory</li>


  <li>ACE version 5.4.7 and place it in the "&lt;root&gt;3rdparty/ACE_Wrappers" subdirectory</li>


  <li>INPOUT32 library and place it in&nbsp;"&lt;root&gt;/3rdparty/inpout32" subdirectory</li>


</ol>

After installing the libraries in the specified location, you need to
build library files for ACE and INPOUT32. Specifically for ACE you need
to choose the right project file (ACE-static.sln) to build static
libraries: ACEs.lib (release) and ACEsd.lib (debug). After building the
inpout32 project you need to copy the <span style="font-weight: bold;">inpout32.dll</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;root&gt;/micro-manager-1.0/bin</span>, because this dll is required at run-time.
<h2>1.4 Device libraries and SDK's</h2>

Some device adapter require the installation of manufacturer's&nbsp;SDKs in order to build. All SDKs should be installed in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;root&gt;/3rdparty</span>
directory. The actual names of SDK directories should match the paths
in the corresponding header files in the Mciro-manager source code for
device adapters.<br>

<br>

If you don't want to build one or more device adapters (because you
don't have the SDK), you should remove corresponding projects from the
master solution: <span style="font-weight: bold;">MMCoreJ_wrap.sln</span>.<br>

<br>

<h1>2. Setting up library paths</h1>

SDK and open source library paths should be set in MSDEV before
launching a build. All&nbsp;3rdparty&nbsp;static and dynamic libraries
required for linking are referred in project files&nbsp;without
absolute paths - therefore the paths must be set though the usual
project settings for default libraries in MSDEV (Tools|Options menu).<br>

<br>

Default library paths must be set for ACE, JDK, INPOUT32 and optionally for required device dependent SDK's.<br>

<h1>3. Building the&nbsp;C++ layer: MMCore and device adapters</h1>

You can build C++ part of the project by opening <span style="font-weight: bold;">MMCoreJ_wrap.sln</span>
in MSDEV and running the full build. This will build the MMCore, Java
wrappers and all device adapters. You can remove any device adapter
project from the solution if you don't have the corresponding SDK or if
you don't need to build it.<br>

<br>

<h1>4. Building the Java layer: Micro-Manager Studio</h1>

Java layer of the Micro-Manager can be build using the standard ANT utility with <span style="font-weight: bold;">build.xml</span> project file, located in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;root&gt;/micro-manager-1.0/mmStudio</span> directory. Before running the build the project file <span style="font-weight: bold;">build.xml</span> must be modified to specify paths for external libraries: ImageJ and BeanShell.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;!-- EDIT PATHS BELOW TO MATCH YOUR SYSTEM --&gt;</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;!-- Specify the system path to the ImageJ root directory --&gt;</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;property name="ImageJPath" value="C:/Program Files/ImageJ"/&gt;</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;!-- Specify the system path to the beanshell jar --&gt;</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;property name="beanshell" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; value="C:/projects/3rdparty/BeanShell/bsh-2.0b4.jar"/&gt;</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;!-- DO NOT MODIFY FROM THIS POINT ON --&gt;</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

<br>

<h1>5. Building the full source in one step</h1>

To build the entire Micro-Manager source code with a single command, you can use <span style="font-weight: bold;">mmbuild.bat</span>.
You can modify this file to switch between Debug and Release builds,
specify different paths for ANT and MSDEV tools, etc. Required MSDEV
paths for command-line compilation are located in vsvars32.bat file in
the MSDEV installation package.<br>

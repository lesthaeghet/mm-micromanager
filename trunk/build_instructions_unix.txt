Micro-Manager builds have been tested on Mac OS X and linux.

Requirements:
1. Build environment including gcc (on Mac OS X download developer tools from http://developer.apple.com/, on linux install from your distribution).
2. ImageJ.  Download and install from http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html.  Install in either /Applications/ImageJ_dev /Applications/ImageJ /usr/local/ImageJ or /usr/local/imagej. 
3. Beanshell.  Copy bsh-2.0b4.jar from classext/ to the plugins folder of the ImageJ folder installed in step 2.
4. ij.jar version 1.42o or later.  If needed, copy ij.jar from classext/ to the ImageJ folder installed in step 2.
5. swingx.  Copy swingx-0.9.5.jar from classext/ to the plugins folder of the ImageJ folder installed in step 2.
5. ACE.  see https://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nico/MMwiki/index.php/Building_ACE_on_the_Mac

6. SWIG.  Download from http://www.swig.org/download.html and install

Building Micro-Manager:
1. Unpack the downloaded micro-manager tarball:
   tar -zxvf micro-manager-1.0.tar.gz
2.  Configure, make and install:
   cd micro-manager-1.0
   ./configure
   make
   make install
The last step should be executed as root (use sudo whenever possible).
The configure script recognizes the following options (on top of the standard ones):
    --without-imagej  // Build without the ImageJ-based GUI 
    --with-imagej=path   // use when ImageJ is not installed in the above listed directories

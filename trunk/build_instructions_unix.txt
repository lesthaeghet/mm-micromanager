Micro-Manager builds have been tested on Mac OS X and linux.

Requirements:
1. Build environment including gcc (on Mac OS X download developer tools from http://developer.apple.com/, on linux install from your distribution).
2. ImageJ.  Download and install from http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html.  Install in either /Applications/ImageJ_dev /Applications/ImageJ /usr/local/ImageJ or /usr/local/imagej. 
3. Beanshell.  Download bsh-2.0b4.jar from http://www.beanshell.org/download.html and copy to the plugins folder of the ImageJ folder installed in step 2.
4. ACE.  Download from http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/, build and install (including a static version of the library):
   cd ACE_wrappers
   mkdir build 
   cd build 
   ../configure --enable-static
   make  
   make install 
The last step will need to be executed as root (use sudo when possible).  Building ACE can take a long time.  
5. SWIG.  Download from http://www.swig.org/download.html and install

Building Micro-Manager:
1. Unpack the downloaded micro-manager tarball:
   tar -zxvf micro-manager-1.0.tar.gz
2.  Configure, make and install:
   cd micro-manager-1.0
   ./configure
   make
   make install
The last step should be executed as root (use sudo whenever possible).
The configure script recognizes the following options (on top of the standard ones):
    --without-imagej  // Build without the ImageJ-based GUI 
    --with-imagej=path   // use when ImageJ is not installed in the above listed directories

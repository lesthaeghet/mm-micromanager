<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Select devices to be automatically synchronized with the camera.<br>
The camera will wait for each device in the synchro list to finish current actions, before taking an image.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Selecting a large number of devices for the synchro list may degrade
system peformance. Select only devices that are likely to
interfere with imaging, such as filter wheels and stages.<br>

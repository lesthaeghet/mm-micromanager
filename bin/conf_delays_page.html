<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Some devices
can't signal when they are done with a command, so that we have to
guess by manually setting this delay. &nbsp;This means that the device
will signal to be busy for the specified delay time after executing
each command.<br>
<br>
Devices that may require setting the delay manually are mostly shutters
or filter wheels. If the device has normal synchronization capabilities, or
if you are unsure, leave this parameter at 0.<br>

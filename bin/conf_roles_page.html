   <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><b>Default device roles</b> must be defined.<br>
This is especially important for systems with multiple cameras,
shutters or stages. The GUI needs to know which camera is going to be
treated as default, which shutter will be associated with the camera
and which stage is going to be used for focusing (Z dimension). These
roles can later be changed on-the-fly through configuration presets.

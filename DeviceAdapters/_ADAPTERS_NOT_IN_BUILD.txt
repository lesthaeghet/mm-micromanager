- CanonEDSDK: Attempt to get the Canon SDK to work, gave up since the callback that was supposed to be generated by the camera never called back...
- NIDAQ: Interface to one of the NI APIs.  This actually worked (on the Mac), but I got so disappointed while working on it that I switched to using the Arduino.
- Rapp: In progress
- StanfordPhotonics: Superseded by Piper

// So you've made a 60 degrees projection of a stack beginning at 330 degrees
// (because this is the equivalent of -30 degrees) and you want to export it looping
// back and forth to .AVI or .MOV
// If you simply save it as is, it will play forwards and then jump back to the
// beginning.
// This macro solves the problem by keeping the stack in its forwards 
// orientation and by reversing the stack and adding it at the end.
